- 👋 Hi, I’m @DamianNiolet.
- 👀 I’m interested in tech as a means to an end as a serial social empire building entrepreneur.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create and install a global daemon script to be loaded at boottime...I know...kid's stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quadruple-booting MacBook Pros with the four major OS's - macOS, Winows, Linux, and ChromeOS.
- 📫 How to reach me on any social platform as @DamianNiolet; I'm the only one in the world.
